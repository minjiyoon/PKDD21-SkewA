# Graph Fraud Detection Based on Accessibility Score Distributions

We focus on a trait that is hard for fraudsters to manipulate:
*uni-directionality* of communication between honest users and fraudsters. 
We define an *accessibility score* to quantify the uni-directionality and propose SkewA, a novel fraud detection method that measures the skewness in accessibility score distributions
and uses it as an honesty metric.
